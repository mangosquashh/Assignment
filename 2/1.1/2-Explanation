1. #include <stdio.h> is a header file library for input/output functions
2. int variable because i'm using 2 whole numbers for this code
3. printf function to show where the user will enter the numbers and to print out the results
4. scanf function to read the numbers given by the user in order to print out results 
5. 'sum = num1 + num2' it shows how the 2 integers will be calculated to get the results.
   In this case, we used addition.
6. the '%d' inside the scanf function refers to the integers
   '&num' refers to the specific integer (num1 for example)
7. return 0 to end the code
